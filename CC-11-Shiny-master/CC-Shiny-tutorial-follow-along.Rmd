## Purpose
This is a follow-along document reporting my engagement with Coding Club's [Getting Started with Shiny](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/shiny/index.html) tutorial. Most of the content is lifted directly from there with minor modifications and updates from my part. Not everything in the tutorial should be expected to be replicated here.
